      "and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\n",
      "their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\n",
      "received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\n",
      "house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\n",
      "almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by\n",
      "such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\n",
      "come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\n",
      "of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\n",
      "at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\n",
      "only seen at church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined\n",
      "the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them\n",
      "civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\n",
      "acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\n",
      "almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\n",
      "much more than to any other person in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a\n",
      "welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,\n",
      "moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\n",
      "talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\n",
      "at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\n",

      "towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a\n",
